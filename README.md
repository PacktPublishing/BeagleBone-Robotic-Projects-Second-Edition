# BeagleBone Robotic Projects - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [BeagleBone Robotic Projects - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/beaglebone-robotic-projects-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788293136), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Beaglebone Blue is effectively a small, light, cheap computer in a similar vein to Raspberry Pi and Arduino. It has all of the extensibility of today's desktop machines, but without the bulk, expense, or noise. And the new features of the BeagleBone Blue make it even easier to use in DIY robotics projects.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter04.

Chapters 1, 2, 6, 9  does not  have code files

The code will look like the following:
```
void loop() {
delay(500);
unsigned int uS1 = sonar1.ping();
unsigned int uS2 = sonar2.ping();
unsigned int uS3 = sonar3.ping();
Serial.print(uS1 / US_ROUNDTRIP_CM);
Serial.print(“,”);
Serial.print(uS2 / US_ROUNDTRIP_CM);
Serial.print(“,”);
Serial.println(uS3 / US_ROUNDTRIP_CM);
}
```
